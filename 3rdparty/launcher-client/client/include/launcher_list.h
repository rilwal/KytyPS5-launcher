/*
 * launcher_list.h: draw lists (docs/plugin-api.md, "Draw lists"), the quick menu as the shell's
 * renderer would draw it, for the game to draw itself over its own frames.
 *
 * With LC_CAP_DRAW_LISTS the shell sends lists instead of drawn buffers, and lc_overlay_begin hands
 * them over already checked (lc_frame.list). lc_list_read is the same check, for tests and tools.
 *
 * A list is the whole screen. Drawing one: write the globals and the background uniform, apply
 * the glyph updates and image ops, upload the instances, make each blur, then draw each pass,
 * scissored, a draw at a time with its image bound. Every pointer below points into the list's
 * own bytes; records are little-endian, as laid out here, so on a little-endian machine they're
 * read in place.
