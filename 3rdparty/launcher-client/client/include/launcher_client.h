/*
 * launcher_client.h: an emulator's side of the game launcher's plugin protocol
 * (docs/plugin-api.md), as a game session.
 *
 * When launcherd starts a patched emulator it sets LAUNCHER_ENDPOINT (a Unix socket path, or a
 * pipe name on Windows) and LAUNCHER_SESSION (a token for this game session). lc_connect()
 * connects back, says hello and waits for the welcome; after that the emulator reports its status,
 * achievements and pauses with the calls below, and the launcher draws all UI.
 *
 * Messages go out on a writer thread of the library's own, so no emulator thread ever waits on
 * the launcher (lc_failed and lc_flush are the exceptions, and say so). What the launcher asks
 * for arrives through lc_callbacks, on the library's reader thread.
 *
 * Strings are UTF-8 and NUL-terminated; the library copies whatever it keeps. Calls on a NULL
 * session do nothing, so code needn't check for launcher mode at every call.
 *
 * The composited overlay (sharing the shell's quick menu into the game's frames) is in
 * launcher_overlay.h, and its optional Vulkan helper in launcher_overlay_vk.h.
